## Spatial Regression with INLA

This is data published in Jama 29/4/2020 on COVD-19 in New York. The New York borough shapefiles were obtained from New York Open Data at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Borough-Boundaries/tqmj-j8zm. For those wishing to evaluate other datasets, thereâ€™s lung cancer data in SpatialEpi library, lip cancer, leukemia in DClusterm library. Key aspect of spatial regression is that neighbouring regions are similar and distant regions are less so. It uses the polyn2nb in spdep library to create the neighbourhood weight. This section uses Bayesian modeling for regression with fitting of the model by  INLA. https://www.r-bloggers.com/spatial-data-analysis-with-inla/. The Rmd file is contained within the NewYork folder.
